The vectors add a dimension to the output array. The resulting dimensions are: `(batch, sequence, embedding)`. \n",

The number of outputs (units, nodes, or neurons) is the dimension of the representational space for the layer. In other words, the amount of freedom the network is allowed when learning an internal representation.\n",

However, it makes the network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns—patterns that improve performance on training data but not on the test data. This is called *overfitting*, and we'll explore it later."

    "Notice the training loss *decreases* with each epoch and the training accuracy *increases* with each epoch. This is expected when using a gradient descent optimization—it should minimize the desired quantity on every iteration.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This isn't the case for the validation loss and accuracy—they seem to peak after about twenty epochs. This is an example of overfitting: the model performs better on the training data than it does on data it has never seen before. After this point, the model over-optimizes and learns representations specific to the training data that do not *generalize* to test data. For this particular case, we could prevent overfitting by simply stopping the training after twenty or so epochs."
