# Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow2.0
In this notebook, we will classify movie reviews as *positive* or *negative* using the text of the review. It would be an example of binary or two-class classification, an important and widely applicable kind of ML problem. <br>
We will be using the **IMDB** dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Databse. We will use 25,000 reviews as training data and the rest 25,000 as the testing data. Both sets contain equal number of negative and positive reviews.
